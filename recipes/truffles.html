    <h2> Easy Truffle Ingredients</h2>
    <ul> These are the ingredients you will need to make this easy truffle recipe:
        <li><b>Chocolate</b>:the better the quality, the better the truffle. But still so luxurious made with mainstream brand chocolate you get in grocery stores. Just be sure to use the chocolate you buy in the baking aisle, not eating chocolate. Baking chocolate is made for melting smoothly, eating chocolate does not melt properly and also has a different consistency once it resets.</li>
        <li><b>Cream</b>: full fat all the way! I am not just being fussy here, it is actually required. Do not use a cream with less than 30% fat because then the chocolate will not firm up enough to scoop and roll (as I found out the hard way when I attempted to make ‚Äúlow fat‚Äù chocolate truffles, SERIOUSLY WHO DOES THAT??!!)</li>
        <li><b>Butter</b>: it adds another layer of richness to the chocolate truffles as well as assisting with consistency (because butter firms up in the fridge to make the mixture roll-able but then softens once the truffles are at room temp). </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Make sure that the truffle mixture is properly chilled before rolling them so I recommend chilling for at least 5 hours, preferably overnight. Do not be tempted to freeze it to speed it up because then the chocolate will set unevenly which will result in some parts that are too hard to scoop out.</li>
        <li>Keep your hands cold with an ice pack or a bag of frozen peas (covered with a tea towel). I have hot little hands. Plenty of built-in insulation. üòÇ Which is great for saving on the power bill in winter. Not so good for making chocolate truffles because my hot little hands melt the chocolate while I am rolling the balls so they slip and slide everywhere.</li>
    </ol>
